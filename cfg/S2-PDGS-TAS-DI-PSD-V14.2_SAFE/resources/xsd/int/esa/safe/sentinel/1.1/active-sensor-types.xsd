          Also known as Pulse Recurrency Frequency. It is the average number of
          pulses/interrogations per second transmitted by the RADAR. The Pulse
          Repetition Frequency is to be expressed in Hertz (Hz).

          Specifies the frequency of the carrier used for conveying a message
          from a transmitter to a receiver. A typical example of message may be
          a telemetry or a telecommand channel. The Transmission Frequency is
          to be expressed in Hertz (Hz).

   <!-- Polarisation -->
   <xs:simpleType name="polarisationType">
      <xs:annotation>
         <xs:documentation>
         For radars designed to transmit either vertically polarised or
         horizontally polarised radiation. This means that the electric field
         of the wave is in a vertical plane or a horizontal plane. Likewise,
         the radar can receive either vertically or horizontally polarised
         radiation, and sometimes both. The planes of transmitted and received
         polarisation are designated by the letters H for Horizontal and V for
         Vertical. Thus the polarisation of a radar image can be H/H, for
         horizontal transmit, horizontal receive, V/V for vertical transmit,
         vertical receive, H/V for horizontal transmit vertical receive, and
         vice versa (V/H). Also, for alternate transmit and receive
         polarization, the value can be HV/HV; for horizontal transmit and
         alternate receive, the value can be H/HV; for vertical transmit and
         alternate receive, the values can be V/VH or V/HV.
